    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="title">Overview</h2>
      Through this project, I analyze and identify flaws in an existing inteface
      and practice the redesign workflow by creating low and high fidelity
      prototypes for various screen sizes and building a responsive website based
      on those prototypes.

    <!-- Interface Introduction -->
    <div class="section">
      <!-- the interface pictures -->
      <h2 class="title">The Original Interface: Home Page</h2>
      <p>The first step in the redesign process was to select an interface and analyze its flaws.
         I selected the home page of a popular roller skating rink located in San Francisco.
         Below you will find a preview of the interface.</p>
      <div class="row_container">
        <div class="col_text">
          <h3>Immediate View</h3>
          <img class="website" src="web.png" alt="home page with scattered images and videos">
        </div>
        <div class="col_text">
          <h3>View After Scrolling</h3>

    <!-- Usability Issues Overview -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="title"> Usability Evaluation</h2>
      <p> The next step in the redesign process is to find potential flaws in the interface's usability.
      Below you will find an evaluation of the interface's usability as defined by its learnability,
      efficiency, and memorability.</p>
      <!-- Learnability -->
      <div class="bottom_margin">
        <span class="bold_large">Learnability</span>
        <ul>
          <li>The navbar makes it easy for first-time users to navigate to different pages</li>
          <li>The body of the site is scattered with unaligned images, videos, and floating links, that make it difficult to locate key information,
          like address, hours of operation, and contact info</li>
          <li>Both hyperlinked and standard underlined text are red at times, making it difficult to distinguish one from the other</li>
          <li>The user must discover which flyers/images on the page are linked to other pages. Not all do!</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <!-- Efficiency -->
      <div class="bottom_margin">
        <span class="bold_large">Efficiency</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Because this interface lacks any sort of hierarchy or categorization in the page's body,
              even a user who is familiar with the interface would need to scroll and pick through
              scattered media, making featured media perusing inefficient.
          </li>
          <li>Navigation bar usage would be efficient for experienced users.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <!-- Memorability -->
      <div class="bottom_margin">
        <span class="bold_large">Memorability</span>
        <ul>
          <li>The navbar is easily memorable and will allow returning users to regain proficiency easily</li>
          <li> Because of the overwhelming amount of content in the body of the home page, users could have
               a less than easy time relearning how to use the body portion of interface effectively.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <!-- Accessibility Evaluation -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="title">Accessibility Evaluation</h2>
      <p>
        This interface had several accessibility concerns including a few major concerns.
        The biggest concern being that the navigation bar was not at all identified by the
        screenreader, meaning that these options would not be accessible for someone
        relying on a screenreader. The WAVE report indicated that this interface had no
        page or region structure. The interface used many tables with no data, included empty
        links, and did not include any alt text.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!-- lo-fi prototypes -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="title">
        Low-Fidelity Prototypes
      </h2>
      <p>
        The next step in the process was to create high-level designs develop a
        solution to the usability issues presented in the previous section. These are
        called low-fidelity or lo-fi prototypes.
        Below you will find a lo-fi prototype for the redesign interface on desktop,
        mobile, and tablet, with annotations explaining what each change addresses.
      </p>
      <h3>Desktop Lo-fi Prototype</h3>
      <div class="">
        <img class="website"src="lofi_annotated_web.jpg" alt="annotated low-fidelity web page">
      </div>
      <h3>Tablet and Mobile Lo-fi Prototypes</h3>
      <div class="">
        <img class="website"src="lofi_annotated_mobiles.jpg" alt="annotated low-fidelity web page on tablet and mobile phone">
      </div>
    </div>
    <!-- hi-fi prototypes -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="title">High Fidelity Prototypes</h2>
      <p>
        The penultimate step is to create a high-fidelity or hi-fi prototype for the interface on
        desktop, mobile, and tablet sizes. These prototypes include all design choices,
        like color, font, layout, hiearchy, etc. Below you will find 3 high-fidelity Prototypes
        annotated with notes to the developer about how the interface should respond
        to each size.
      </p>

      <h2 class="title">Final Responsive Redesign</h2>
      You can view my final redesign here: <a href="https://redesigned-church.herokuapp.com/"> https://redesigned-church.herokuapp.com/</a>
      <p>After running a screenreader and WAVE analysis on my final product, I managed to fixed some of
      the major issues with the original interface using solely html tags to define hierarchy. I hope the
    owners of the original interface will choose to implement these changes into their site so it can be more accessible
      to their users. </p>
